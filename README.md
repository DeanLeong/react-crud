# React + CRUD

## Learning Objectives

- Perform create, read, update, delete actions in JavaScript using Axios
- Use the Airtable API to store our data
- Create a React frontend to interact with our data

## What is CRUD

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete -- which are four common actions you take on websites. We are going to learn how to use these actions to retrieve, store, and modify data.

| Type of Request | What's It Do? | An Example URL                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`           | Read          | [http://localhost:3000/dogs](http://mywebsite.com/dogs)    |
| `POST`          | Create        | [http://localhost:3000/dogs](http://mywebsite.com/dogs)    |
| `PUT`           | Update        | [http://localhost:3000/dogs/2/](http://mywebsite.com/dogs2) |
| `PATCH`         | Update        | [http://localhost:3000/dogs/2/](http://mywebsite.com/dogs/2) |
| `DELETE`        | Delete        | [http://localhost:3000/dogs/2/](http://mywebsite.com/dogs/2) |
